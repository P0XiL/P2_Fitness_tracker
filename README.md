# P2 Project - Fitness and Health Tracker 


-  ## Introduction
This project was made as a P2 project. Software has been developed based on the case: Fitness and Health Tracker. Through an analysis of the subject, a problem statement was found: How can a web-based application be developed to motivate users to cultivate better physical activity habits based on user-specific health and fitness tracking information?
This repository contains a proposed solution.

      Multiple tests are present in the program but commented out. For each test to work, the present data in the JSON files mustn't be changed.
